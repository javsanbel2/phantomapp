## Brief Technical Design Document

# Motivation

Javascript web app that maintains a list of bookmarks through local storage. The user is able to add/edit/delete 
any link in the list with the following actions.

- Add a bookmark in home form.
- Edit a bookmark pressing above it on the table.
- Delete a bookmark pressing the trash on the table.

# Techonologies

The technologies used to this applications were the following:

- Application developed with the framework Angular 8.3.19.
- Material Angular to use modals and forms.
- I used HTML & CSS to develop the basic layout even though I would prefer use SCSS.

# Limitations

I can understand the design is very basic, does not have any special. About Google Closure,
I saw a module to integrate with Angular that could works, but I only did the research, I
did not implemented it.
